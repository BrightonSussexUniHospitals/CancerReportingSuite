## A little bit about this joint venture from Perspicacity Ltd & Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals
Perspicacity provides decision support consultancy, coaching, & development to the NHS. They are passionate about reducing the cost of software development to the NHS and aspire to create an active community of NHS and commercial organisations. They all share a common goal of improving the quality and efficiency of patient care through better, and more informed, decision making.

Open source helps the healthcare community to do this by sharing software development, learning from each other, and help software meet the needs of every organisation without being constrained to a single solution or paying for the same piece of work over and again across different organisations.
This project came from a voluntary effort to improve the cancer reporting within our local acute trust. We hope to encourage others to share a common code set with us, collaborating as one NHS rather and unifying our reporting for greater consistency. If you would like to contribute, please get involved!
